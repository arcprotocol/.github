# ARC Banner Image

This is a placeholder for the ARC Protocol banner image that should be named `arc_banner.jpeg`.

## Banner Requirements:
- File name: `arc_banner.jpeg`
- Location: `.github/arc_banner.jpeg`
- Size: Recommended width of 1200px or more for good display on GitHub
- Content: The ARC logo and "Agent Remote Communication Protocol" text as shown in the shared image

## Implementation:
1. Save the shared image (from the user's message) as `arc_banner.jpeg`
2. Place it in the `.github` directory
3. The README.md is already set up to reference this image file

Once the banner image is in place, this placeholder file can be deleted.
